**Gomoku**
This is a Gomoku platform that supports both player-vs-player and player-vs-computer gameplay.

The core algorithm, as seen in sample.cpp, utilizes an alpha-beta pruning search strategy, supporting 6-ply search depth with a 6-ply look-ahead for kill moves.

To start the game, run run.py.
